- Confused at the beginning, thought he would keep buying stuff
- Liked drawing items for the scenes
- Plot started making sense after whiskey
- Too big of a leap between buying items and starting the crime arc
- Seemed like the items bought in the first 2 Phases were unimportant/random
- Suggested that the items you buy are what's broken during the crime
- Suggested destroyed versions of the items that were bought
- Mechanic of drawing made the dialog irrelevant and unnecessary
- Dialog prompts are not necessary if the narrative is conveyed mechanically
- Slower transitions could better convey narrative

What to do:
- Remove the "task notes". Not necessary
- Start playing sounds for execution during the transitions


Pivot Ideas:
1) Recontextualize the narrator character as not amnesiac
2) De-emphasize the gendered domestic violence
3) De-emphasize the mechanics for the sake of emphasizing the narrative (make the presence of the story equal to the presence of the drawing)
