- Confused at the beginning, thought he would keep buying stuff
- Liked drawing items for the scenes
- Plot started making sense after whiskey
- Too big of a leap between buying items and starting the crime arc
- Seemed like the items bought in the first 2 Phases were unimportant/random
- Suggested that the items you buy are what's broken during the crime
- Mechanic of drawing made the dialog irrelevant and unnecessary
- Dialog prompts are not necessary if the narrative is conveyed mechanically

What to do:
- Phase 1 items should be reworked into "decorations" that show up in the bedroom during Phase 4, and "groceries" that show up in the kitchen during Phase 5. We need to communicate visually about which PostIts are intended to hold which type of item, so that we can copy them into the appropriate phases.
- PHASE 1 REWORK:
 LIST:
  -GROCERIES-
   - Bread
   - Cereal
   - Salt/Pepper Shaker
  -DECORATIONS-
   - Socks
   - Deodorant

- Ending sequence, which should be a series of transitional images, with dialog boxes, clarifying that this was a recollection happening inside a therapy session. Dialog should help wrap up the narrative and clarify that all dialog boxes came from the therapist. Player Character can finally have a few dialog lines accepting responsibility for the event - these should be in a different box style and font.
- PHASE 2.5 IMPLEMENTATION
 - DONE
